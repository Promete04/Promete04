<h3> About Me:</h3>
</div>
I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at UAH, deeply passionate about Embedded Systems and the Cybersecurity architectures that protect them. My primary interest lies in securing hardware within critical settings, where reliability and robustness are paramount.

I thrive at the intersection of hardware and software, exploring how we can anchor trust in physical devices to secure critical infrastructure against sophisticated threats.

<h3> Current Focus & Research:</h3>
</div>

I am actively expanding my expertise in hardware security primitives and network infrastructure:

* Researching Hardware Trust: I am currently deep-diving into PUFs (Physical Unclonable Functions) and FPGAs. My goal is to understand how silicon fingerprinting can be used for authentication and cryptographic key generation in hostile environments.

* The <img src="https://github.com/Promete04/homelab" alt="Homelab" /> Project: I devote my spare time to building and maintaining a comprehensive HomeLab. This serves as my personal testing ground for network segmentation, service deployment, and security configuration simulations.
